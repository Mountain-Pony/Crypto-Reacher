Crypto Reacher is a tool for analyzing bitcoin's market value for 
a given date range.<br />
Supports BTC & EUR and for now only bitcoin can be chosen from 
the dropdown menu. However, it is possible to add more cryptos later
if the need arises.<br />

## Quick guide
Download everything and keep file and folder structure intact.<br />
Open index.html in your browser.<br />
Choose a date range by selecting a start date and an end date.<br />
There is a dropdown menu for selecting cryptos but for now it is a placeholder 
of sorts and comprises only bitcoin which is chosen by default and can't be 
changed in this version of Crypto Reacher.<br />
Finally, click 'Execute' to run the program.<br />
